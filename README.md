WEATHER FORECAST WEB/ANDROID APP - Predicts weather after parsing the JSON returned by Google Geocode API and Forecast.io API
This app is a part of assignment for CSCI571 under Prof. Marco Papa

For the web version, used Facebook Login (JS), JQuery, Ajax, Amazon AWS and Bootstrap to create a responsive and user-friendly experience. It can be accessed here (dunno until when): http://cs-server.usc.edu:55937/WF-Ankur.html

For the Android version, used JSON GET (HTTP Request) to get data using the same script at Amazon AWS server. Parsed JSON to display the results. Also, used AERIS Map API to put the weather layer on top of Google Maps. 
You can import the project on Android Studio and then run it on emulator/device to check out the app.
